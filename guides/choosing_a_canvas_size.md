## Choosing a Canvas Size  

The aspect ratio used on the profile page is 2.25:1 (aka 9:4). This is not a common aspect ratio, though it still easy to work with.  

## Comparison to Common Aspect Ratios

Here are some common aspect ratios from photography and film media overlayed on the profile canvas:  
### 1:1 (Square Ratio)

The `1:1` aspect ratio, popular in social media content, brings a strong focus to the center of the frame.  
It is highly symmetrical, and works well if you want a close crop on your subject. 

### 4:3 (A Classic Ratio)

The `4:3` aspect ratio, seen commonly in digital and analog cameras, as well as old TVs before HD content, gives a nostalgic feel.  
Because the ratio is near-square, there is still an emphasis on the center of the frame. 

### 16:9

The `16:9` aspect ratio is everywhere. The standard computer screen size for more than 20 years, this ratio is the standard for digital media.
Considered "widescreen", this modern aspect ratio can capture a panoramic feel. The rule of thirds works great for composing here.

### 2.39:1 (Anamorphic Widescreen)

The `2.39:1` aspect ratio is most commonly seen in movies. Audiences will immediately associate images in this ratio with a "cinematic" feel.  
Scenes in this aspect ratio feel incredibly wide and panoramic. You can use this to really emphasize the distance between multiple subjects.
