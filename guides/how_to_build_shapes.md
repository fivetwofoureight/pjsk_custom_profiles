## How to Build Shapes

Many of the most unique custom profiles feature original art.  
From paintings, chibis, GFX, comics, and shoutouts to other media, original art is a great way to make a profile stand out.  
However, drawing an entire image from scratch only using the limited options in the editor requires a lot of practice to get right.  
One great way to get familiar with the options in the editor is to start with a monochrome icon or logo.  

When building a logo for one of the characters or groups in Project Sekai, I usually follow these steps:

* [Search for inspiration and references on Pinterest](#Searching-for-Inspiration)
* [Brainstorm and draft ideas in an image editor](#Brainstorming-and-Drafting-Ideas)
* Generate guides for the custom profile
* Use text objects to build the logo methodically

## Searching for Inspiration

* Whether it be trendy or niche, there's surely a Pinterest rabbit hole to go down
* Collecting references can be both easy and fun
* Some keywords that have been popular recently are:

_GFX_ - "Graphics", slick designs like you see in User Interfaces, Magazines, and Posters.  
Popular topics include anime, manga, video games, and K-pop.

_Y2K_ - "Year 2000", inclusive of 90s and early 2000s trends featuring imagery such as stars, globes, and tech.  
Also influenced by street culture, fashion, music, and company branding.

_Abstract Design_ - Influenced by the Brutalism, Bauhaus, and Industrial design.   
Commonly features blocks, molecules, chrome, concrete, and heavy fonts.

* Truly, you can find inspiration anywhere, so jump on Pinterest and start saving references.
* For the sake of this guide, I'll be using [this post called BANKS Logo](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/746471706998268140/)

## Brainstorming and Drafting Ideas

* Once I have an idea or reference, I'll use [GIMP, a free image editor](https://www.gimp.org/), to start brainstorming.
* GIMP can be overwhelming if you're trying to understand everything at once. I suggest learning as you go.
* I'll start by creating a large page and importing my references as layers.

* Then I'll use the Pen tool to create a Path of some parts that I'd like to adapt for my profile.
* I like using the Pen tool because the Paths it creates can be repeatedly modified or transformed

* I've taken a part of the 'B' and used it to make a lowercase 'n'. The 'S' is a '5' now, and I used a flipped copy of it to made it into a 2.

* With this draft, I'll stroke each Path with Line, crop, and export to a `.png`

* I'll copy the file into my Rainmeter directory and load it over the profile editor.
