## How to Build Shapes

Many of the most unique custom profiles feature original art.  
From paintings, chibis, GFX, comics, and shoutouts to other media, original art is a great way to make a profile stand out.  
However, drawing an entire image from scratch only using the limited options in the editor requires a lot of practice to get right.  
One great way to get familiar with the options in the editor is to start with a monochrome icon or logo.  

When building a logo for one of the characters or groups in Project Sekai, I usually follow these steps:

* [Search for inspiration and references on Pinterest](#Searching-for-Inspiration)
* Brainstorm and draft ideas in an image editor
* Generate guides for the custom profile
* Use text objects to build the logo methodically
