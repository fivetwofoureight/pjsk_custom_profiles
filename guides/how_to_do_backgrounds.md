## How to do Backgrounds

When building a custom profile, the first step is usually to establish a background or canvas.  
There's a few ways to do this, but I'd like to highlight 3 simple approaches that I often use:

* [Solid Color Background](#Solid-Color-Background)
* Image as Background
* Patterns as Background

## Solid Color Background

* This approach will make the entire background 1 color.
* First, create a text object with this text:

```
<scale=15><mark=#000000>a
a
a
a
a
a
```

* Set the [hex color code](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/), which is `#000000`, to your desired color

* Set the `Font Size` slider to the maximum and the `Line Spacing` slider to the minimum

* You now have a solid background to start building your profile on.
