## System Setup

I build all of my profiles on PC using an emulator, keyboard, and mouse.

There's many benefits to this:

* Larger screen size
* Complete accuracy when moving objects
* Ability to copy-paste text
* Ability to zoom in and out
* Ability to overlay reference images
* Ability to use color pickers

## My Thoughts on Emulators

> ‼️ Use emulators at your own discretion. ‼️  

* SEGA/ColoPale do not provide offical support for emulators.
* I cannot vouch for the security of any specific emulator.
* Moving from your main device to the emulator will count as a device transfer.
    *  Keep the [T300 Device Transfer Limit in mind](https://support-pjsekai.sega.com/hc/en-us/articles/26712908149273-Unable-to-account-transfer-after-getting-a-message-that-says-Account-Transfer-Limit)!
* If you are using transfer codes, I suggest having backups in at least 3 places.
    * ex: in the Notes app, a Google Doc, and a `.txt` file on pc
    * Losing your transfer code may result in inability to access to your account.
