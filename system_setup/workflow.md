## Workflow

An effective workflow will allow you to both:  

* build a larger variety of custom profiles
* build profiles quicker

As mentioned in [System Setup](system_setup/system_setup.md), I use:

* [Bluestacks 5](#Bluestacks-5)
* Windows Magnifier
* Rainmeter
* Windows PowerToys Color Picker
* VSCode

## Bluestacks 5

There's a lot of settings that you can tweak, but the relevant ones for building profiles are:

#### Performance Tab

* Frame rate: `60`

#### Display Tab

* Display Resolution: `Landscape`, `1920 x 1080`
    * Generally any 16:9 resolution will maximize the screen area that the profile canvas occupies
    * Depending on the screen resolution of your PC and other tools you want open, you can increase/decrease.

## Windows Magnifier

* Using the built in Magnifier and setting a level with `WIN +` or `WIN -` zooms in on the cursor.
* There's 3 modes, but the default fullscreen mode is what I use the most often.
* At the highest magnification levels, you can align objects with single-pixel percision.
    * Using a mouse rather than a touch allows you to cleanly release objects and not have a finger in the way.
