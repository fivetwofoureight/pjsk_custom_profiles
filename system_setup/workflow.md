## Workflow

An effective workflow will allow you to both:  

* build a larger variety of custom profiles
* build profiles quicker

As mentioned in [System Setup](system_setup/system_setup.md), I use:

* [Bluestacks 5](#Bluestacks-5)
* Windows Magnifier
* Rainmeter
* Windows PowerToys Color Picker
* VSCode

There's a lot of settings that you can tweak, but the relevant ones for building profiles are:

#### Performance Tab

* Frame rate: `60`

#### Display Tab

* Display Resolution: `Landscape`, `1920 x 1080`
    * Generally any 16:9 resolution will maximize the screen area that the profile canvas occupies
    * Depending on the screen resolution of your PC and other tools you want open, you can increase/decrease.
